# Lift Off Sedna Compiler
The lift-off version of the Sedna compiler is intended to simply get the process started towards being self-hosted. It is a temporary measure; however, on the other hand, it might stick around for a while as the primary compiler.

## C# Version or Python Version
The Python version is a quick prototype attempt to gain some traction in the development of the compiler and the important advanced features needed to realize an effective language. The C# version is stalled at the moment but is intended to be used to re-implement any discoverys that are made in the Python version. Python offers a very dynamic typed environment which provides rapid development of advanced structures and systems needed but does so in a slow and sloppy manner.

## State

Both the versions of the compiler are in development and neither is functionally usable at the moment.
